# Emotion-classification-with-wavelett-scattering-features-and-MLP-classifier

The classification of emotions from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals holds great importance for the development of advanced technologies in affective neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces. This field faces considerable challenges due to the complexity and variability of EEG signals, making it difficult to create robust and generalizable algorithms. In this proyect, the use of the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WS) was evaluated as a technique for extracting descriptors from EEG signals. This was done with the objective of improving the performance of emotion classifiers. The proposed approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional feature extraction methods, offering greater generalization capacity.

The methodology was evaluated using the DEAP database, a benchmark in the study of emotion recognition using EEG. The results show that the WS-based classifier, combined with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and PCA for dimensionality reduction, achieved high performance with accuracies exceeding 95\% in the classification of the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, Dominance, and Liking using 5-fold cross-validation.
